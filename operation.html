                        I worked in a team of 4 to implement a retro shooting game using Unity, C#, and Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. The educational part of the game involved computer/programming-based questions that the user needs to answer while shooting the enemies. I was responsible for the functioning of most of the gameplay elements in the game such as the enemies, player, and lives. I implemented the game over screen which included the total score of the player and UI options such as retry, main menu option, and the quit button.  I completed the tasks which were allocated to me and worked together to complete the tasks of other team members. I constantly provided valuable feedback and looked after the progress of the project. During my role as a sprint leader, I organized the team meetings, took stand-up reports, and provided updates for the members who could not attend the class. This was my first experience with working in a team and learning to use git commands,<br> source tree and handle merge conflicts.
