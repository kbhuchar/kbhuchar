						During the project, I worked in a team of 4 to create a review and rating website targeted at Knox students( Freshman and Prospective students). The website would provide valuable feedback for students on the various locations and services offered at Knox, and allow students to add reviews and ratings for the services. I had to learn how to use many new components and tools as we went along. It was a big challenging to learn the basics of Vuejs, Python, Flash, and Mongodb all at the same time. The biggest challenge was to figure out how each component interacts with each other and the flow of data between them. We spend an extensive amount of time during the first spring making sure how the front and backend connect. Once we learned the basics of the tools, progress on new features increased. 
During the first spring, I worked extensively on the frontend, creating a template for the values for the backend to be displayed. I learned about using grids, flex-containers for responsiveness, computed to pass a function call, and implemented existing CSS frameworks such as bootstrap. 

I learned how to access and use the variables stored in the database from the backend to the front end. 
During the project, we encountered many issues, and learning where and when to look for help by finding the root of the problem and breaking it into components was a major part of the project. 

During my role as a sprint leader, I organized team meetings, took stand-up reports, and provided updates for the members who could not attend the meetings. 

At the end, we were able to achieve our project objectives through constant communication, dedication, teamwork, and commitment.
