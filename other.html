                        Scotland Yard (java): <br>
                        The project was a part of my applied data structure course during  freshman year.
                        The objective was to show the possible moves a player could take from a given location on the board and to get us introduced with implementing Hashmaps. 
                        I made a graph that showed the possible moves from a given location on the board.
                        There would be limited possible moves as the player could only take a bus, taxi, or train to get to a certain location.
                        I created a graph by using Hashmap. So, we could store the neighbors of a location in the hashmap and also store what vehicle should be used to get to a certain location.<br>

                        Plagiarism detector (java):<br>
Project for CS-220 class (Applied Data Structures) course. The objective of the project was to check whether two files were plagiarised and to get us introduced with implementing HashSet. 
For the project, I created a map of String to a Hashset. The key was the name of the file and the hash set contained the n-grams. I first calculated the common n-grams of the given two files to check whether they were plagiarised. The two files were classified as plagiarised if 40% of the n-grams were common between the two.<br>
<br>
Ascii Adventure(C#)<br>
The project was part of our CS 208( Programming languages) course in which we had to learn 3  programming languages (RUBY,C#,Clojure) and work on small projects. 
The assignment was implemented using C# where I had to build 3 new features to an already existing game. 
Feature 1: I created an extra life feature by creating a new object in the game and counting if the player had collected the object using a counter. We check if the player has collected the extra life by checking if the row and column of the player equals that of the extra life. I created an if statement to check if the game ends if the mob catches the player.  The new feature was a subclass of a class called GameObject which defined the row, column, screen, if the object is passable, and delete of the other game objects. 


Feature 2: I created a feature called moving walls, the walls moved randomly by getting a list of legal moves and using the Tuple feature to group the data types. The feature was a subclass of class MovinggameObjects which defined the row , column and the random movements of the game objects by increasing the rows and columns. 
Feature 3:Increased the row or column of the player by using directional action IJKL.
