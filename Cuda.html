                        Research Project<br> 
                        <br>
						The goal of the project was to implement an image processing algorithm specifically the blur algorithm in parallel. The project required an understanding of the programming language C in which  I had no prior knowledge and experience with. I worked in a team of 3 during the project, and I took the responsibility to get myself comfortable with programming in C by taking online courses, following documentation and a number of online tutorials. To get ourselves familiarized with NVIDIAâ€™S CUDA framework, we implemented vector addition and matrix multiplication. I contributed to the team by implementing the algorithm in CPU, and used the algorithm as a base and converted it into parallel in the CUDA framework. We then altered the code and converted it into a skeleton code such that the code reads in the image and students only had to code the parallel part to help them understand the important concepts of CUDA and HPP( Heterogeneous parallel programming. At the end of the project we presented our work to the science department.
